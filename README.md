# Electricity Sales in California: A Time Series Analysis Approach

### Abstract

This time series analysis project aims to analyze and forecast elec- tricity sales using historical data from 2010 to 2023. The project utilizes electricity sales data from the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) and aims to provide valuable insights for forecasting and making inferences. The analysis involves several key steps: time series decomposition, residual analysis, ARMA model fitting, predicting future values, and spectral analysis. We accurately forecast values and find that there exists strong annual and semi-annual components in the data.
